* Nodes walkability is no longer stored as an attribute, but computed on the fly with respect to the map passed to init Jumper

##1.5.2.2 (11/02/12)
* Bugfix on resetting nodes properties (Thanks to Srdjan MarkoviÄ‡)
* Bugfix on path cost return

##1.5.2.1 (10/27/12)
* Bugfix (Thanks to Srdjan MarkoviÄ‡)

##1.5.2 (10/25/12)
* Fixed "tunneling" issue in diagonal-mode

##1.5.1.3 (10/18/12)
* Third-party 30log requiring enhanced
* Huge documentation update (See Readme)

* Bugfix with the previous commit (requiring third-party would not work with Löve2D, now fixed)

##1.5.1.2 (10/16/12)
* Fix on internal grid width calculation
* Added path to 30log in package.path
* Some code cleaning


##1.5.1.1 (10/15/12)
* Smoothing renamed to filling, self-explanatory (See Readme for public interface changes)

##1.5.1 (10/09/12)
* Fix for pathfinding with no diagonal moves allowed : paths returned looks more "natural".

##1.5.0 (10/06/12)
* Added support for collision maps starting at locations different than (1,1).

* Various improvements
* Updated Readme

##1.4.1 (10/04/12)
* Third-parties are now git submodules.
* Bugfix with grid reset process
* Optimized the grid reset process. Successive calls to <tt>pather:getPath()</tt> yield faster.

##1.3.3 (10/01/12)
* Removed useless lines of code

##1.3.2 (09/26/12)

* Updated Readme

##1.3.1 (09/25/12)
* Jumper no longer uses internally Lua's <tt>module</tt> function.
* Global env pollution bugfix
